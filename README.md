# üöÄ **LLM-Powered-G2P Repository**

Welcome to the LLM-Powered-G2P repository! Here you will find all the code and resources related to "LLM-Powered Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion: Benchmark and Case Study". This project introduces innovative methods to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) tasks without the need for additional training. The repository features two main components: Sentence-Bench and Kaamel-Dict.

## üìÅ Repository Content

### Sentence-Bench
Sentence-Bench provides a benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs on G2P tasks. It includes a diverse set of test cases to assess the ability of LLMs to accurately convert graphemes to phonemes. Researchers and developers can use this benchmark to compare different models and approaches in the G2P domain.

### Kaamel-Dict
Kaamel-Dict is a lexicon specifically designed for Persian language G2P tasks. It contains a comprehensive collection of grapheme-phoneme mappings for Persian words. By leveraging Kaamel-Dict, users can enhance the accuracy and reliability of G2P conversions for Persian text.
